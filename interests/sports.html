  <div class="desc">Basketball - I get connected to those I play with, not only growing closer with playmates 
  but also I have developed respect for those I play against. Basketball has taught me to trust my playmates, teaches me to be a good team player
  and pushes me to get back up and keep playing, no matter how bad the score may be. </div>

  <div class="desc">Swimming - Regular swimming helps build heart muscles. It allows your heart to pump blood at a faster rate and increases your blood circulation, 
  all of which reduces your risk for cardiovascular diseases and helps you maintain a healthy body. When youâ€™re in the water, however, all other noise, including your thoughts, are silenced. 
  In fact, swimming and yoga share qualities, as they both aid in flexibility and produce a relaxation response. </div>
